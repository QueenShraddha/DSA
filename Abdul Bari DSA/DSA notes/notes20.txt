display a linked list

for this we will first learn how to traverse a linked list
we start from the first node
please note that the first pointer (head) must not be disturbed,so we will use a temporary pointer to traverse the linked list

struct Node *p = first;
// p=p->next means that p has moved to the next node
//this process has to be done repeatedly in order to travers the linked list
we will stop once the linked list reaches p=0 or NULL

code:
while(p!=NULL){
    p=p->next;
}

while traversing we can do a lot of things, like searching sorting inserting, counting nodes, etc

to display

display(struct Node *p){
    while(p!=NULL){
    printf("%d->",p->data);
    p=p->next;
}
}
