int, float , boolean, binary, hexadecimal, octal, arrays,charecters etc --> primitive data types

linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, maps, trees, etc --> user defined data types (structs, classes, objects ke help se we can make these)

linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, maps, trees -> data structures


DS are a grp of data with a certain functionality
Data structure is a particular way of storing and
organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

array - {2,3,4,5} 2->3->4->5

(DS+functions)--> abstract data types 

(LL) + (insert,delete,display) --> ADT


LL -> insert, delete, display, etc
stacks -> push, pop, display, top 
queues-> rear, front, delete, insert


Problem -> chai bnao
certain steps--> algorithm

make a linked list and display it 

An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.

[99,3,10,1,80] --> sort kardo 

Effeciency
TIME EFFECTIVE -- time complexity ---> time
SPACE EFFECTIVE -- space complexity ---> memory


Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is
most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.


algo 1 - t1 time -- s1 memory 
algo 2 - t2 time -- s2 memory

fairly -- mathematical calculation of time complexity

5 elements--faster
100000 elements - slower

f(n) g(n) purely mathematically based 
fair comparison of 2 or more algos
